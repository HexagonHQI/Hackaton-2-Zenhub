1. Overall Impression:
This project is far too simple for this stage of the course.

2. Technical Implementation:
No use of any relevant technologies.

3. User Experience:
The CSS is very simple and needs to be enhanced.

4. Strengths:
--

5. Areas for Improvement:
- The structure of the project is very bad. you should have at least made css and js folders.
- There was no use of node.js or database.

6. Final Thoughts:
The project is a few HTML pages and that's it. The CSS is subpar, and the JavaScript is non-existant.
